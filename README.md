# DNDSync
This App was developed to enable synchronization between the smartphone and the **Galaxy Watch 4** of the
**Do Not Disturb** (*DND*) and **Bedtime mode** from [Digital Wellbeing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wellbeing&hl=en_US).
*DND* synchronization is only supported officially if using a Samsung phone with this smartwatch, Bedtime mode synchronization
is only newly available for the newest Pixel Watch 2:
* With this repo you get ***both***!

**Functionalities:**
* *1-way sync* or a *2-way sync* of **DND**, depending on the preferences
* Automatically toggle **Bedtime** mode for the watch whenever it is activated on the phone
    * At night, when I charge my phone, bedtime mode on the phone is enabled and I wanted to sync and enable same mode on the watch
* Automatically toggle **Power Saver** mode in combo with bedtime mode on the watch, whenever bedtime mode is synced from the phone

Majority of the credits goes to [@rhaeus](https://github.com/rhaeus) for the initial developing of this app
and to [@DreadedLama](https://github.com/DreadedLama) for the initial developing of a better bedtime mode implementation!

**Tested on Nothing Phone (1) (*Android 13*) paired with a Galaxy Watch 4 (*40mm*, *Wear OS 4.0*)**

## Setup

***Manual installation is required. The use of ADB is required. (*Don't worry, it's very easy!*)***

* Download the latest `.apk` files from the ['Releases' section](https://github.com/lazerl0rd/dnd-bedtime-sync/releases) (`dndsync-mobile.apk` and `dndsync-wear.apk`)
* Be sure to enable notifications for Bedtime mode of the Digital Wellbeing app on your phone (*They are by default*)
    * This app knows that bedtime mode is activated when its notification pops up (since there's no public API for the *Digital Wellbeing* app)

### Phone

<img src="/images/mobile_updated.png" width="300">

1. Install the app `dndsync-mobile.apk` on the phone via *adb*
    * Enable `USB Debugging` in the *Developer Options* of your phone and the connect it to the PC
    * Run `adb install dndsync-mobile.apk`
2. Disconnect the phone from the PC
    * Disable `USB Debugging` from the *Developer Options* of your phone
3. Open the app and grant the permission for *DND Access* and *Bedtime Access* by clicking on the menu entry *DND-Bedtime Permission*. This will open the permission screen.
    * This Permission is required so that the app can *read/write* DND state and *read* Bedtime mode. Without this permission, the sync will not work.
4. Go back on the app and check that `DND-Bedtime Permission` say **DND-Bedtime access granted** (*you may need to tap on the menu entry for it to update*)
5. Turn on the switch for the mode that you'd like to sync (*you can enable both, of course*):
    * With the ***Sync DND state to watch*** switch you can enable and disable the sync for *DND* mode.
      If enabled, a *DND* change on the phone will lead to *DND* change on the watch.
    * With the ***Sync Bedtime mode to watch*** switch you can enable and disable the sync for bedtime mode.
      If enabled, when *Bedtime mode* is *enabled/disabled/paused* on the phone, it will be *enabled/disabled/paused* on the watch

Setting up the watch is a bit more *tricky* since the watch OS lacks the permission screen for DND access,
but the permission needed can be **easily set via ADB***!

Note: This is only tested on my **Galaxy Watch 4** and it might not work on other devices!
1. Connect the watch to your computer via **adb** (watch and computer have to be in the *same network!*)
    * Enable Developer Options: Go to `Settings -> About watch -> Software -> tap the Software version 5 times -> developer mode is on (you can disable it in the same way)`
    * Enable `ADB debugging` and `Debug over WIFI` (in `Settings -> Developer Options`)
    * Click on `Pair new device`
    * Note the watch IP address and port, something like `192.168.0.100:5555` 
    * Note also the pair key, something like `123456`
    * Pair the watch with `adb pair 192.168.0.100:5555 123456` (***insert your value!***)
    * Now you will be brought back to the *Debug over WIFI* menu, note the **new port**, something like `:6666`
    * Connect to the watch with `adb connect 192.168.0.100:6666` (The ip address stays the same, the port changes!)
2. Install the app `dndsync-wear.apk` on the watch
    * Run `adb install dndsync-wear.apk`
3. Grant permission for **DND access** (*This allows the app to listen to DND changes and to change the DND setting*)
    * Run `adb shell cmd notification allow_listener de.rhaeus.dndsync/de.rhaeus.dndsync.DNDNotificationService`  
4. Grant permission for **Secure Setting access** (*This allows the app to change BedTime mode setting on the watch*)
    * Run `adb shell pm grant de.rhaeus.dndsync android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`
5. Open the app on the watch, scroll to the permission section and check if both `DND Permission` 
   and `Secure Settings Permission` say ***Granted*** (*you may need to tap on the menu entries for them to update*)
6. ***IMPORTANT: Disable `ADB debugging` and `Debug over WIFI`, because these options drain the battery!***
7. Turn on the switch for the mode that you'd like to sync (*you can enable all of them, of course*)
    * If you enable the setting ***Sync DND*** in the App, a DND change on the watch will lead to a DND change on the phone
    * If you enable the setting ***Bedtime Mode*** in the App, the watch will copy the bedtime mode status of the phone, it's a 1-way sync
    * If you enable the setting ***Power Saver Mode*** in the App, the watch will turn on power saver mode whenever the *Bedtime Mode* is synced from the phone
    * If you enable the setting ***Vibration*** in the App, the watch will vibrate whenever it receives a sync request from the phone

## To do (developers)

There are only two flags which the *Power saver mode* of this app does not enable but which are enabled
by the *Power saver mode* of the watch itself:

* Change screen timeout setting to *10 sec* when *Power Saver Mode* is enabled, just like it is if enabled via the watch
* (Optional) For coherence, also the *wake up the watch by tilt* should be disabled via code. This is optional since it is 
  disabled automatically whenever the low power mode is enabled and does not require setting manually the flag to 0, but still

Pull requests are welcome!

## Note

If you are unable to "Allow Notification Access" to the mobile app and it is faded, go the apps section in Settings, open DNDSync app, click 3 dots on top right and grant "Allow Restricted Settings" access.
Now you'll be able to grant the Notification access to mobile app.
