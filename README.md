# DNDSync
This App was developed to enable Do Not Disturb (DND) synchronization between my Pixel phone and the Galaxy Watch 4 
since this option was only available if paired with a Samsung phone.

If installed on phone and watch it enables either a 1-way sync or a 2-way sync of DND, depending on the preferences.
I also added the functionality to automatically toggle Bedtime Mode. Use case: At night I put my phone into DND and I want my watch to automatically enable Bedtime Mode.
This functionality is realized via modifying secure settings.


Part of this project is inspired by [blundens](https://github.com/blunden/DoNotDisturbSync) work, please check their GitHub if you want to know more.

_**Tested on Pixel 3a XL paired with a Galaxy Watch 4 (40mm)**_

## 

## Setup
_For now the App is not in the Play Store. Manual installation is required. The use of ADB is required._
* Download the .apk files from the release section (_dndsync_mobile.apk_ and _dndsync_wear.apk_)

### Phone

<img src="/images/mobile.png" width="300">

* Install _dndsync_mobile.apk_ on the phone `adb install dndsync_mobile.apk`
* Open the App and grant the permission for DND Access by clicking on the menu entry _DND Permission_.
This will open the permission screen. This Permission is required so that the app can read and write DND state.
Without this permission the sync will not work.
* With the switch _Sync DND state to watch_ you can enable and disable the sync. If enabled a DND change on the phone will lead to DND change on the watch.

### Watch

Setting up the watch is a bit more tricky since the watch OS lacks the permission screen for DND access. I found a way to enable the permission via ADB.

Note: This is only tested on my Galaxy Watch 4 and it might not work on other devices!
* Connect the watch to your computer via adb (watch and computer have to be in the same network!)
  * enable Developer Options: Go to Settings -> About watch -> Software -> tap the Software version 5 times -> developer mode is on (you can disable it in the same way)
  * enable _ADB debugging_ and _Debug over WIFI_ (in Settings -> Developer Options)
  * note the watch IP address and port, something like `192.168.0.100:5555`
  * connect to the watch with `adb connect 192.168.0.100:5555` (_**insert your value!**_)
* install the app `adb install dndsync_wear.apk`
* grant permission for DND access  
`adb shell cmd notification allow_listener de.rhaeus.dndsync/de.rhaeus.dndsync.DNDNotificationService`  
This allows the app to listen to DND changes and changing the DND setting
* scroll to the permission section and check if DND permission says _access granted_ (you might need to tap on the menu entry for it to update)
* If you want to use the Bedtime mode feature you have to grant the app access to modify secure settings.
Grant permission for Secure Setting access.
  `adb shell pm grant de.rhaeus.dndsync android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`
* This allows the app to change BedTime mode directly without the need for accessibility.
You can enable this by enabling the _Bedtime Mode_ Setting in the App.
* _**IMPORTANT: Disable ADB debugging after you are done because it drains the battery!**_
* If you enable the setting _Sync DND_ in the App a DND change on the watch will lead to a DND change on the phone
* If you enable the setting _Bedtime Mode_ in the App the watch will copy the bedtime mode status of the phone, it's a 1-way sync.
* If you enable the setting _Vibration_ in the App the watch will vibrate when it receives a DND sync request from the phone

# Note
If you are unable to "Allow Notification Access" to the mobile app and it is faded, go the apps section in Settings, open DNDSync app, click 3 dots on top right and grant "Allow Restricted Settings" access.
Now you'll be able to grant the Notification access to mobile app.

All credit goes to the original developer (rhaeus) for the great app.
